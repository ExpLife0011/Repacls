  "body": "Repacls Usage Information\r\n\r\n`repacls.exe /Path <Absolute Path> ... other options ....`\r\n\r\n`Repacls was developed to address large scale migrations, transitions, health `\r\n`checks, and access control optimizations.  Repacls is multi-threaded and `\r\n`employs account name caching to accelerate operation on large file servers  `\r\n`with millions of files.  It was developed to address a variety of platform `\r\n`limitations, resource consumption concerns, and bugs within xcacls, icacls, `\r\n`setacl, and subinacl.  `\r\n\r\n`Repacls must be executed with administrator permissions and will attempt to `\r\n`acquire the backup, restore, and take ownership privileges during its `\r\n`execution.`\r\n\r\n`Any command line parameter that accepts an account or domain name can also use`\r\n`a SID string instead of the name.  This may be necessary if working with an`\r\n`account or domain that is no longer resolvable.`\r\n\r\n`Global Options`\r\n`==============`\r\n`Global Options affect the entire command regardless of where they appear in the`\r\n`passed command line.  It is recommended to include them at the very beginning`\r\n`or end of your command as to not confuse them with ordered parameters.`\r\n\r\n`/Path`\r\n   `Specifies the file or directory to process.  If a directory, the directory`\r\n   `is processed recursively; all operations specified affect the directory `\r\n   `and all files and folders under the directory (unless otherwise specified).`\r\n   `This parameter is mandatory.`\r\n\r\n`/Quiet`\r\n   `Hides all non-error output. This option will greatly enhance performance if`\r\n   `a large number of changes are being processed.  Alternatively, it is `\r\n   `advisable to redirect console output to a file (using the > redirector) if `\r\n  `/Quiet cannot be specified.`\r\n\r\n`/Threads <NumberOfThreads>`\r\n   `Specifies the number of threads to use while processing.  The default value`\r\n   `of  '5' is usually adequate, but can be increased if performing changes `\r\n   `over a higher-latency connection.  Since changes to a parent directory `\r\n   `often affect the inherited security on children, the security of children`\r\n   `objects are always processed after the the security on their parent objects`\r\n   `are fully processed. `\r\n\r\n`/WhatIf`\r\n   `This option will analyze security and report on any potential changes `\r\n   `without actually committing the data.  Use of /WhatIf is recommended for `\r\n   `those first using the tool.`\r\n\r\n`/NoHiddenSystem`\r\n   `Use this option to avoid processing any file marked as both 'hidden' and`\r\n   `'system'.  These are what Windows refers to 'operating system protected `\r\n   `files' in Windows Explorer.`\r\n\r\n`Ordered Options`\r\n`===============`\r\n`Ordered Options are executed on each SID encountered in the security descriptor`\r\n`in the order they are specified on the command line.  Executing commands in this`\r\n`way is preferable to multiple commands because the security descriptor is only`\r\n`read and written once for the entire command which is especially`\r\n`helpful for large volumes.`\r\n\r\n`Commands That Do Not Alter Security`\r\n`-----------------------------------`\r\n`/PrintDescriptor`\r\n   `Prints out the security descriptor to the screen.  This is somewhat useful`\r\n   `for  seeing the under-the-cover changes to the security descriptor before `\r\n   `and after a particular command.`\r\n\r\n`/CheckCanonical`\r\n   `This command inspects the DACL and SACL for canonical order compliance `\r\n   `(i.e., the rules in the ACL are ordered as explicity deny, explicity allow, `\r\n   `inherited deny, inherited allow).  If non-canonical entries are detected,`\r\n   `it is recommended to inspect the ACL with icacls.exe or Windows Explorer`\r\n   `to ensure the ACL is not corrupted in a more significant way.`\r\n\r\n`/ExportDescriptor <FileName>`\r\n   `Export the security descriptor to the file specified.  The file is `\r\n   `outputted in the format of file|descriptor on each line.  The security `\r\n   `descriptor is formated as specified in the documentation for`\r\n   `ConvertSecurityDescriptorToStringSecurityDescriptor().`\r\n\r\n`/FindAccount <Name|Sid>`\r\n   `Reports any instance of an account specified.`\r\n\r\n`/FindDomain <Name|Sid>`\r\n   `Reports any instance of an account matching the specified domain.  `\r\n\r\n`Commands That Can Alter Security (When /WhatIf Is Not Present) `\r\n`--------------------------------`\r\n`/Compact`\r\n   `This command will look for mergable entires in the security descriptor and`\r\n   `merge them.  For example, running icacls.exe <file> /grant Everyone:R`\r\n   `followed by icacls.exe <file> /grant Everyone:(CI)(OI)(R) will produce`\r\n   `two entries even those the second command supersedes the first one.  `\r\n   `Windows Explorer automatically merges these entries when display security `\r\n   `information so you have to use other utilities to detect these `\r\n   `inefficiencies.  While these's nothing inheritance wrong with these `\r\n   `entires, it possible for them to result file system is performance `\r\n   `degradation.  Replace will automatically run compact ACL that needs to`\r\n   `be modified; this option is used to unconditionally look for and`\r\n   `modify ACLs that would otherwise not need to be modified.`\r\n\r\n`/MigrateDomain <SourceDomainName|Sid>:<TargetDomainName|Sid>`\r\n\t`This command will look to see whether any account in <SourceDomain>`\r\n    `has an identially-named account in <TargetDomain>.  If so, any entires`\r\n     `are converted to use the new domain.  For example,`\r\n    `'OldDomain\\Domain Admins' would become 'NewDomain\\Domain Admins'.  Since`\r\n    `this operation relies on the names being resolvable, specifying a SID `\r\n    `instead of domain name for this command does not work.`\r\n\r\n`/RemoveAccount <Name|Sid>`\r\n    `Will remove <Name> from the security descriptor.  If the specified name`\r\n    `is found as the file owner, the owner is replaced by the builtin `\r\n    `Administrators group.  If the specified name is found as the group owner`\r\n    `(a defunct attribute that has no function in terms of security), it is `\r\n    `also replace with the built-in Administrators group.`\r\n\r\n`/RemoveOrphans <Domain|Sid>`\r\n   `Remove any account whose SID is derived from the <Domain> specified`\r\n   `and can no longer be resolved to a valid name.  Instead of <Domain>,`\r\n   `you can pass '!FORCE!' to remove all orphaned SIDs but this should be`\r\n   `used under extreme caution since any SID that cannot be resolved to`\r\n   `a name will be removed.  For example, SID that maps to a local group`\r\n   `on a remote server may not be queryable for group names and therefore`\r\n   `may be recognized as orphaned even though they are not.`\r\n\r\n`/RemoveRedundant`\r\n   `This command will remove any explicit permission that is redundant of`\r\n   `of the permissions its already given through inheritance.  This option`\r\n   `helps recovered from the many indivual explicit permissions that may`\r\n   `have been littered from the old cacls.exe command that didn't`\r\n   `understand how to set up inheritance.`\r\n\r\n`/ReplaceAccount <SearchAccount> <ReplaceAccount>`\r\n   `Search for an account and replace it with another account.`\r\n\r\n`/SetOwner <Name|Sid>`\r\n   `Will set the owner of the file to the name specified.`\r\n\r\n`/SidHistoryFix`\r\n   `Will convert any instances of old SIDs present in the security descriptor`\r\n   `to there to active SID currently associated with the account.  This is`\r\n   `especially useful after a domain migration and prior to removing`\r\n   `excess SID history on accounts.  `\r\n\r\n`Exclusive Options`\r\n`=================`\r\n`/Help or /? or /H`\r\n   `Shows this information.`\r\n\r\n`/ResetChildren`\r\n   `This will reset all children of path to the to inherit from the parant.  It`\r\n   `will not affect the security of the parent.  This command does not affect `\r\n   `the security the root directory as specified by the /Path argument.`\r\n\r\n`/InheritChildren`\r\n   `This will cause any parent that is currently set to block inheritance to`\r\n   `start allowing inheritance.  Any explicit entries on the children are`\r\n   `preserved.  This command does not will not affect the security the root `\r\n   `directory as specified by the /Path argument.`\r\n\r\n`Other Notes & Limitations`\r\n`=========================`\r\n`To only affect a particular part of a security descriptor, you can add on an `\r\n`optional ':X' parameter after the end of the account name where X is a comma`\r\n`separated list of DACL,SACL, OWNER, or GROUP.  For example,`\r\n`'/RemoveAccount \"DOM\\joe:DACL,OWNER\"' will only cause the designated account`\r\n`to be removed from the DACL and OWNER parts of the security descriptor. `\r\n \r\n`Examples`\r\n`========`\r\n`- Replace all instances of DOM\\jack to DOM\\jill in C:\\test:`\r\n  `repacls.exe /Path C:\\Test /ReplaceAccount \"DOM\\jack:DOM\\jill\"`\r\n\r\n`- Migrate all permissions for all accounts with matching`\r\n  `names in DOMA with DOMB:`\r\n  `repacls.exe /Path C:\\Test /MigrateDomain DOMA:DOMB`\r\n\r\n`- Update old SID references, remove any explicit permissions that are already `\r\n  `granted by inherited permissions, and compact all ACLs if not compacted:`\r\n  `repacls.exe /Path C:\\Test /SidHistoryFix /RemoveRedundant /Compact`\r\n\r\n`Type 'repacls.exe /? | more' to scroll this documentation.`\r\n",
